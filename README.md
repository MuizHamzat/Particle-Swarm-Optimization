# Particle-Swarm-Optimization

This was an assignment from my MECHTRON2MP3 course.

The purpose of this assignment was to implement the particle swarm optimization in C, and determine the optimal fitness value of the given function. The PSO function in this assignment takes multiple arguments: the objective function, number of dimensions, the lower and upper bounds, the number of particles to be used, and the max number of iterations to go through.

```main.c``` is used to run test cases on the program. The tested objective functions can be found [here](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/optimization.html "Optimization Test Problems").
